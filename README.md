What kind of fish(Salmon) related app is this? LOL

Not at all, this is a simple Android app that allows you to track your received orders in your WordPress + Wp Ecommerce shopping site.

**My dream about this stupid app is**:

* Allows you to check your current Order data live fetched from your site.
* Fetch your customer data from the order and you can call them, text them or send them an email directly from your android device (As long they provide their phone/mobile number). (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
* Also integrate this app for other shop plugin for wordpress (eg. Yak, Cart66, WooCommerce etc.).(NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

But the reality is, I just start learn Android development, have not enough time to focus on this app, and there are already other app similar to this and much better of course.

**The point is, this is just for fun project, learning project, what i have learned so far**:
## [WPS Connect](https://aapks.com/apk/wps-connect/)

* How to create custom layout instead to use the original one.
* How to style ListView.
* How to create custom ListView.
* How to connect to internet and fetch some data from it.
* How to parse JSON.
* How to use AsyncTask to avoid your app to freeze when it in action.
* How to work with Preferences, Shared and the custom one.

Thats it, i think it's enough for a beginner like me.
